# Manage Your Server: Studio Config

Here you can configure the following:

### Server-Wide Settings

- Send anonymous usage statistics,
- Warn when using System Database,
- Choose studio theme color related to an environment, so you will be able to easily distinguish between production and testing boxes, for example.

- Disable event source (alternative way to notify studio about server side changes if websockets aren't available),
- Choose number format
