# Status: Gather Debug Info

RavenDB supports a debug info package creation. This package contains information about the current database and server, such as statistics, configuration, logs, metrics, and more. This helps troubleshooting database issues (more on error reporting and submitting support tickets [here](../../../server/troubleshooting/sending-support-ticket)).

Using the options from the `Action Bar` you can create and download a package.
