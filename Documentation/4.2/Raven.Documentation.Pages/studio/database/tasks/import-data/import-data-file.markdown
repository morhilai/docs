# Import data from .ravendbdump file

A .ravendbdump file is RavenDB format for exporting a database and it is backward compatible between RavenDB versions.  
In order to import a `.ravendbdump` we need an existing database, lets create `Northwind` database and select `Setting`.

## Advanced import options

### Transform Script

![Figure 6. Advanced Import Options - Transform Script](images/import-from-file-advanced-transform-script.png "Advanced Import Options - Transform Script")

- Use Transform Script: when enabled will allow to supply a transform javascript script to be operated on each document contained by the file

{CODE-BLOCK:javascript}
delete this['@metadata']['@change-vector']
// The script above will delete the change-vector from imported documents
// and will generate new change vectors during import. 
// This is very helpfull if the data is imported from a diffrent database group
// and you want to avoid adding old change vector entries to a new environment. 
{CODE-BLOCK/}
