# Batch Commands

---

{NOTE: }

* Use this endpoint with the **`POST`** method to send multiple commands in one request:  
`<server URL>/databases/<database name>/bulk_docs`  

* The commands are sent as a JSON array in the [request body](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#body).  

* All the commands in the batch will either succeed or fail as a **single transaction**. Changes will not be visible until 
the entire batch completes.  

* [Options](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#batch-options) can be set to make the server wait 
for indexing and replication to complete before returning.

{PANEL: Basic Example}

This is a cURL request to a database named "Example" on our [playground server](http://live-test.ravendb.net).  
It batches two commands:  

1. Upload a new document called "person/1".  
2. Execute a [patch](../../../client-api/operations/patching/single-document) on that same document.  

{CODE-BLOCK: bash}
curl -X POST "http://live-test.ravendb.net/databases/Example/bulk_docs"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-d "{
    \"Commands\": [
        {
            \"Id\": \"person/1\",
            \"ChangeVector\": null,
            \"Document\": {
                \"Name\": \"John Smith\"
            },
            \"Type\": \"PUT\"
        },
        {
            \"Id\": \"person/1\",
            \"ChangeVector\": null,
            \"Patch\": {
                \"Script\": \"this.Name = 'Jane Doe';\",
                \"Values\": {}
            },
            \"Type\": \"PATCH\"
        }
    ]
}"

{PANEL: Request Format}

This is the general format of a cURL request with a batch of commands that _does not_ include a Put Attachment Command 
(see the format for batching a Put Attachment Command [below](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#put-attachment-command)):  

{CODE-BLOCK: bash}
curl -X POST "<server URL>/databases/<database name>/bulk_docs?<batch options>"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-d "{
    \"Commands\": [
        { <command> },
        ...
    ]
}"
{CODE-BLOCK/}
Linebreaks are added for clarity.  
<br/>
#### Query String

The query string takes [batch options](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#batch-options), which 
can make the server wait for indexing and replication to finish before responding.  
<br/>
#### Header

The header `Content-Type` is required and takes one of two values:  

* `application/json` - if the batch _does not_ include a Put Attachment Command.  
* `multipart/mixed; boundary=<separator>` - if the batch [_does_](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#put-attachment-command) 
include a put attachment command. The "separator" is an arbitrary string used to demarcate the attachment streams and commands array.  
<br/>
#### Body

The body contains a JSON array of commands.  

{CODE-BLOCK: powershell}
-d "{
    \"Commands\": [
        { 
            \"Id\": \"<document ID>\",
            ...
            \"Type\": \"<command type>\"
        },
        { <command> },
        ...
    ]
}"
{CODE-BLOCK/}

Depending on the shell you're using to run cURL, you will probably need to escape all double quotes within the request body 
using a backslash: `"` -> `\"`.  

The following commands can be sent using the batch command:  

* [Put Document Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#put-document-command)  
* [Patch Document Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#patch-document-command)  
* [Delete Document Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#delete-document-command)  
* [Delete by Prefix Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#delete-by-prefix-command)  
* [Put Attachment Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#put-attachment-command)  
* [Delete Attachment Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#delete-attachment-command)  

---

### Batch Options

These options, configured in the query string, make the server wait until indexing or replication have completed before responding. If these have not 
completed before a specified amount of time has passed, the server can either respond as normal or throw an exception.  

This is the general format of a cURL request that includes batch options in the query string:

{CODE-BLOCK: html}
curl -X POST "<server_URL>/databases/<database_name>/bulk_docs?<batch option>=<value>
             &<batch option>=<value>
             &<batch option>=<value>
             ..."
-H "Content-Type: <content_type>"
-d "{ }"
{CODE-BLOCK/}
Linebreaks are added for clarity.  
<br/>
#### Indexing Options

| Query Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **waitForIndexesTimeout** | `TimeSpan` | The amount of time to wait for indexing to complete. [Format of `TimeSpan`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timespan). |
| **waitForIndexThrow** | `boolean` | Set to `true` to throw an exception if the indexing doesn't complete before `waitForIndexesTimeout`.<br/>Set to `false` to recieve the normal response body. |
| **waitForSpecificIndex** | `string[]` | Wait only for the listed indexes to finish updating, rather than all indexes. |

#### Replication Options

| Query Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **waitForReplicasTimeout** | `TimeSpan` | The amount of time to wait for replication to complete. [Format of `TimeSpan`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timespan). |
| **throwOnTimeoutInWaitForReplicas** | `boolean` | Set to `true` to throw an exception if the replication doesn't complete before `waitForReplicasTimeout`.<br/>Set to `false` to recieve the normal response body. |
| **numberOfReplicasToWaitFor** | `int`/`string` | The number of replicas that should be made before `waitForReplicasTimeout`. Set this parameter to `majority` to wait until the data has been replicated to a majority of the nodes in the database group. Default = `1`. |

## Commands

### Put Document Command

Upload a new document or update an existing document.  

Format within the `Commands` array in the [request body](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#request-format):  

{CODE-BLOCK: powershell}
{
    \"Id\": \"<document ID>\",
    \"ChangeVector\": \"<expected change vector>\",
    \"Document\": {
        <document content>
    },
    \"Type\": \"PUT\",
    \"ForceRevisionCreationStrategy\": \"Before\"
}
{CODE-BLOCK/}

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| **Id** | ID of document to create or update | Yes to update, [no to create](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#autogenerated-ids) |
| **ChangeVector** | When updating an existing document, this parameter that document's expected [change vector](../../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector).

| **Type** | Set to `PUT` | Yes |
| **ForceRevisionCreationStrategy** | When updating an existing document, set to `Before` to make a [revision](../../../server/extensions/revisions) of the document before it is updated. | No |

---

### Patch Document Command

Update a document. A [patch](../../../client-api/operations/patching/single-document) is executed on the server side and 
does not involve loading the document, avoiding the cost of sending the entire document in a round trip over the network.  

Format within the `Commands` array in the [request body](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#request-format):  

{CODE-BLOCK: powershell}
{
    \"Id\": \"<document ID>\",
    \"ChangeVector\": \"<expected change vector>\",
    \"Patch\": {
        \"Script\": \"<javascript code using $<argument name> >\",
        \"Values\": {
            \"<argument name>\": \"<value>\",
            ...
        }
    },
    \"PatchIfMissing\": {
        \"Script\": \"<javascript code>\",
        \"Values\": {
            <arguments>
        }
    },
    \"Type\": \"PATCH\"
}
{CODE-BLOCK/}

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| **Id** | ID of a document to execute the patch on | Yes |
| **ChangeVector** | The document's expected [change vector](../../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector). If it does not match the server-side change vector a concurrency exception is thrown. | No |
| **Patch** | A script that modifies the specified document. [Details below](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#patch-request). | Yes |
| **PatchIfMissing** | An alternative script to be executed if no document with the given ID is found. This will create a new document with the given ID. [Details below](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#patch-request). | No |
| **Type** | Set to `PATCH` | Yes |

#### Patch Request

Using scripts with arguments allows RavenDB to cache scripts and boost performance. For cURL, use single quotes `'` to 
wrap strings.  

| Sub-Parameter | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| **Script** | Javascript commands to perform on the document. Use arguments from `Values` with a `$` prefix, i.e. `$<argument name>`. | Yes |
| **Values** | Arguments that can be used in the script. | No |

---

### Delete Document Command

Delete a document by its ID.  

Format within the `Commands` array in the [request body](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#request-format):  

{CODE-BLOCK: powershell}
{
    \"Id\": \"<document ID>\",
    \"ChangeVector\": \"<expected change vector>\",
    \"Type\": \"DELETE\"
}
{CODE-BLOCK/}

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| **Id** | ID of document to delete (only one can be deleted per command) | Yes |
| **ChangeVector** | The document's expected [change vector](../../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector). If it does not match the server-side change vector a concurrency exception is thrown. | No |
| **Type** | Set to `DELETE` | Yes |

---

### Delete by Prefix Command

Delete all documents whose IDs begin with a certain prefix.  

Format within the `Commands` array in the [request body](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands#request-format):  

{CODE-BLOCK: powershell}
{
    \"Id\": \"<document ID prefix>\",
    \"IdPrefixed\": true,
    \"Type\": \"DELETE\"
}
{CODE-BLOCK/}

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| **Id** | All documents whose IDs begin with this string will be deleted | Yes |
| **IdPrefixed** | Set to `true` (distinguishes this as a Delete by Prefix Command rather than the Delete Document Command described above) | Yes |
| **Type** | Set to `DELETE` | Yes |

---

### Put Attachment Command

Add an [attachment](../../../client-api/session/attachments/what-are-attachments) to a document, or update an existing attachment.  

If a batch contains a Put Attachment Command, the cURL format of the request is slightly different from a batch that doesn't.  
The `Content-Type` header takes `multipart/mixed; boundary="<separator>"` instead of the default `application/json`.  
The body contains the `Commands` array followed by each of the attachments, passed in the form of binary streams. The attachment streams come in the 
same order as their respective Put Attachment Commands within the `Commands` array. The `separator` demarcates these sections.  

The general form of a cURL request:  

{CODE-BLOCK: powershell}
curl -X POST "<server URL>/databases/<database name>/bulk_docs"
-H "Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=<separator>"
-d "
--<separator>
{
    \"Commands\":[ 
        {
            \"Id\": \"<document ID>\",
            \"Name\": \"<attachment name>\",
            \"ContentType\": \"<attachment MIME type>\"
            \"ChangeVector\": \"<expected change vector>\",
            \"Type\": \"AttachmentPUT\"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
--<separator>
Command-Type: AttachmentStream

<binary stream>
--<separator>
...
--<separator>--"
{CODE-BLOCK/}

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| **boundary** | The "separator" - an arbitrary string that demarcates the attachment streams.<br/>The attachment streams come in the same order as their respective Put Attachment Commands in the commands array.<br/>The string used as a separator must not appear elsewhere in the request body - i.e. "ChangeVector" or "[{" are not valid separators. | Yes |
| **Id** | Document ID | Yes |
| **Name** | Name of attachment to create or update | Yes |
| **ContentType** | Mime type of the attachment | No |
| **ChangeVector** | The document's expected [change vector](../../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector). If it does not match the server-side change vector a concurrency exception is thrown. | No |
