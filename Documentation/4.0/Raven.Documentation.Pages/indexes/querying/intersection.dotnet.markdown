# Querying: Intersection

To allow users to `Intersect` queries on the server-side and return only documents that match **all** the provided sub-queries, we introduced the query intersection feature.

Let's consider a case where we have a T-Shirt class:

{CODE intersection_1@Indexes\Querying\Intersection.cs /}

We will fill our database with few records:

{CODE intersection_3@Indexes\Querying\Intersection.cs /}

Now we want to return all the T-shirts that are manufactured by `Raven` and contain both `Small Blue` and `Large Gray` types.

To do this, we need to do the following:

- add the `Raven.Client.Documents` namespace to usings
- use the `Intersect` query extension:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Query intersection_4@Indexes\Querying\Intersection.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:DocumentQuery intersection_5@Indexes\Querying\Intersection.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Index intersection_2@Indexes\Querying\Intersection.cs /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from index 'TShirts/ByManufacturerColorSizeAndReleaseYear' 
where intersect(Manufacturer = 'Raven', Color = 'Blue' and Size = 'Small', Color = 'Gray' and Size = 'Large') 
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

The above query will return `tshirts/1` and `tshirts/4` as a result. The document `tshirts/2` will not be included because it is not manufactured by `Raven`, and `tshirts/3` is not available in `Small Blue` so it does not match **all** the sub-queries.
