# Cluster Topology test
---

{NOTE: }

* The cluster topology is defined by the type and state of each node in the cluster and the relation between them.  

* Clusters are typically composed of any odd number of nodes equal or greater than 3, see [Clusters Best Practice](../../../server/clustering/cluster-best-practice-and-configuration).

{PANEL: Changing the Topology}

###Fetching the Topology
Any client with [Valid User](../../security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions#user) privileges can fetch the topology from the server 
by sending the following REST API call:  

| Action | Method | URL |
| - | - | - |
| Fetch Topology | `GET` | /cluster/topology |

###Modifying the Topology  
With [Cluster Operator](../../security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions#operator) privileges, 
the client can modify the cluster through the [Studio](../../../studio/server/cluster/cluster-view#cluster-view-operations),  
or by using the following REST API calls:  

| Action | Method | URL |
| - | - | - |
| Add Node | `PUT` | /admin/cluster/node?url=`node-url` |
| Remove Node | `DELETE` | /admin/cluster/node?url=`node-tag` |

Optional parameters (for the Add Node endpoint):

| Name | Value Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| tag | `string` | 1-4 uppercase unicode letters (default: 'A' - 'Z' assigned by order of addition) |
| watcher | `bool` | Add the node as a [Watcher](../../../server/clustering/rachis/cluster-topology#watcher) (default: `false`) |
| assignedCores | `uint` | Number of cores to assign to this node (default: number of processors) |

See the [Cluster API page](../../../server/clustering/cluster-api) for usage examples.

{PANEL: Nodes States and Types}

In Rachis every cluster node has a [state](../../../server/clustering/rachis/cluster-topology#state) and a [type](../../../server/clustering/rachis/cluster-topology#type).  

{NOTE: }

### Type
The type defines the node's ability to **vote** on accepting a new raft command in the cluster,  
and **elect** a new leader when needed.  

| Node Type | Description |
| - | - |
| **Member** | A fully functional voting node in the cluster. |
| **Promotable** | A non-voting node. <br/>This is an intermediate stage until node is promoted by the Leader to a Member. |
| **Watcher** | A non-voting node that is still fully managed by the cluster. <br/>Can be assigned with databases and tasks. See more [below](../../../server/clustering/rachis/cluster-topology#watcher). |
{NOTE/}

{NOTE: }

### State
The Rachis state defines the **current role** of the node in the cluster.

| Rachis State | Description |
| - | - |
| **Passive** | Not a part of _any_ cluster.<br/><br/>Every newly created RavenDB server starts at the initial **Passive** state.<br/>A passive node can become a Leader of a single-node-cluster,<br/>or it can be added to an already existing cluster.<br/><br/>A node that is removed from the topology moves back to the **Passive** state. |
| **Candidate** | Has no Leader and tries to get elected for leadership. |
| **Follower** | Has a Leader and operates normally. |
| **Leader-Elect** | Just elected for leadership, but will take office and become the leader only after the dummy `noop` raft command was successfully applied in the cluster. |
| **Leader** | Leader of the cluster. See more [below](../../../server/clustering/rachis/cluster-topology#leader). |
{NOTE/}

{NOTE: }

![Figure 3. States Transitions](images/cluster-states.png "Cluster Nodes States Flow")

**1.** New server/node will start as **Passive**, meaning it is _not_ part of any cluster yet.  
**2.** When a node is added to a cluster, it immediately becomes the **Leader** if it is the only node in the cluster.  
**3.** When a node is added to a cluster and a Leader already exists, it will become **Promotable** (on its way to either becoming a Member or a Watcher - depending on what was specified when created.)  
**4.** Node will become a **Member** of the cluster if not specified otherwise.  
**5.** Node will become a **Watcher** if specified when adding the node.  
**6.** Member can be `Demoted` to a Watcher.  
**7.** Watcher can be `Promoted` to a Member. It will first become Promotable and a Member thereafter.  
**8.** Member (a regular Member or a Leader - but not a Watcher) can become a **Candidate** when a voting process for a new Leader takes place.  
**9.** When voting is over and a new Leader is elected, one candidate becomes the Leader and the rest go back to being his Followers.  
{NOTE/}

{NOTE: }

#### Leader
 
* The Leader makes sure that decisions are consistent at the cluster level, as long as a majority of the nodes are functioning and can talk to the Leader.  

* For example, the decision to add a database to a node will be either accepted by the entire cluster (eventually) or fail to register altogether.  

* [Raft Commands](../../../server/clustering/rachis/what-is-rachis#implementation-details) can't be accepted while there is no Leader or if the Leader is down.  
{NOTE/}

{NOTE: }

#### Watcher

Increase your RavenDB cluster by adding Watchers with the advantage of _not_ suffering from large voting majorities and the latencies they can incur, 
as watchers donâ€™t take part in majority calculations.  

* A Watcher can be assigned databases and tasks as a regular Member but is not included in the decisions making flow,
  so cluster decisions can be made with a small majority of nodes while the actual size of the cluster can be much higher.  

* Any number of Watchers can be added to handle the workload.

{PANEL: Changing Node Type}

Node types can be altered on the fly by using the following REST API calls:

| Action | Method | URL |
| - | - | - |
| Promote Watcher to be a Member | `POST` | /admin/cluster/promote |
| Demote Member to be a Watcher | `POST` | /admin/cluster/demote |
| Force Elections | `POST` | /admin/cluster/reelect |

See the [Cluster API page](../../../server/clustering/cluster-api) for usage examples.
