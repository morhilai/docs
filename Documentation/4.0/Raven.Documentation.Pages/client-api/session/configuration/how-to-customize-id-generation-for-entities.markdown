# Session: How to Customize ID Generation for Entities

In RavenDB, you will encounter a few ways to create document IDs. We suggest that you should first read the article '[Working with Document Identifiers](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers)' to achieve the basic knowledge about built-in ID generation strategies before you start customizing identifiers of your entities.

In order to dive into ID generation customizations, you need to get familiar with conventions related to the identifiers. There are two dedicated articles that present conventions which you can apply to all entity types or work more selectively and create a ID generation customization for a particular type. Here are the relevant links:

* [Global ID Generation Conventions](../../../client-api/configuration/identifier-generation/global)
* [Type-specific ID Generation Conventions](../../../client-api/configuration/identifier-generation/type-specific)
