# Getting Started: A Few Words About Examples

Most examples in this documentation use the `Northwind` sample database (with minor adjustments) which is fairly popular in .NET, and can be deployed easily using your RavenDB Studio (more information on how to deploy it can be found [here](../studio/database/tasks/create-sample-data)).

Not everything can be showed in easy and understandable manner when `Northwind` is used, so there are some articles with custom examples to better illustrate and describe more sophisticated features.
