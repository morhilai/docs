# Commands: Patches: How to use JavaScript to patch your documents?

**Patch** command is used to perform partial document updates without having to load, modify, and save a full document. This is usually useful for updating denormalized data in entities.

Patching is performed using [bulk_docs endpoint](../../../client-api/commands/batches/how-to-send-multiple-commands-using-a-batch) with [ScriptedPatchCommandData](../../../glossary/scripted-patch-command-data) as payload.
