# Getting started: Few words about examples

Most examples in this documentation are using `Northwind` sample database (with minor adjustments) which is fairly popular in .NET world and can be deployed easily using RavenDB Studio (more information on how to deploy it can be found [here](../studio/overview/tasks/create-sample-data)).

Unfortunately not everything can be showed in easy and understandable manner when `Northwind` is used, so there are some articles with custom examples to better illustrate and describe  more sophisticated features.
