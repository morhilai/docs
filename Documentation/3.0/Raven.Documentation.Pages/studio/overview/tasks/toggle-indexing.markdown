# Tasks: Toggle Indexing

This simple view grants you the ability to pause the indexing process. Note that information concerning the pausing is not persisted so restarting the server will re-enable indexing.

Current status, `Indexing` or `Paused`, is displayed under the `Enable indexing` and `Disable Indexing` buttons.
